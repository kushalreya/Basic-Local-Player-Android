# 🏗 Architecture

This project follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern.

### Why MVVM?

- Clear separation of concerns
- Better maintainability
- Easier testing
- Lifecycle-aware state handling
- Scalable codebase

Purpose:

- Persist user preferences
- Store favorite songs

## Data Fetching Flow
